This blog will be part 1 of a two Part series where we explore bernauli&amp;rsquo;s theorm to get hold of probability of getting a positive experience after buying a product online given that there are number of sellers available and all of them have similar positive reviews based on different number of total reviews for the same product.</description></item><item><title>How I finally understood Bayes Theorem</title><link>https://inderjit.in/post/2020-10-02-first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 11:00:01 +0530</pubDate><author>inder@inderjit.in (Inderjit Singh Chahal)</author><guid>https://inderjit.in/post/2020-10-02-first-post/</guid><description>I came across Bayesian theorem a lot early in my education carrier, much like Thomas Bayes himself, I was not able to grasp the importance of this masterpiece. Additionally, much like most of the concepts at the time I just jumped over the understanding of the same and was mostly focused on solving some predefined pattern questions and never bothered to figure out how the theorem can actually be put to use in the real-world implementations.</description></item></channel></rss>
