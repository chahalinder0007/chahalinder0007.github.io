Additionally, much like most of the concepts at the time I just jumped over the understanding of the same and was mostly focused on solving some predefined pattern questions and never bothered to figure out how the theorem can actually be put to use in the real-world implementations.</description></item><item><title>Recommender System made easier with TFRS</title><link>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/post/2020-09-29-first-post.md/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 11:00:01 +0530</pubDate><author>chahalinder0007.gmail.com (Inderjit Singh Chahal)</author><guid>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/post/2020-09-29-first-post.md/</guid><description>Creating scalable deep learning-based recommendation systems from scratch is a significantly time-consuming task, especially so that we need to spend significant time on the non-productive elements involved in setting up the model for experiments. It is a given that we will need to perform levels of iterations on the model architecture to get optimal hyperparameters for a particular use case.
Google has now launched just the instrument required to reduce the non-productive component in that cycle.</description></item><item><title>Mathematics for solving game of shells</title><link>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/post/2020-09-19-first-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 10:00:01 +0530</pubDate><author>chahalinder0007.gmail.com (Inderjit Singh Chahal)</author><guid>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/post/2020-09-19-first-post/</guid><description>Simple applied mathematics for logical decisions in-game of shells or stocks maybe I shared this post that takes a simple example of Geometric progression and shows how you can quantize and make logical decisions in a game of shells, essentially betting on the outcome to be always profitable.
There was a lot of backlash from people saying its wrong to use mathematics to make money and whatnot. My point simply is, if people are aware they can have a look at mathematics in a different light and can adopt it in general life to make informed decisions.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/page/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>chahalinder0007.gmail.com (Inderjit Singh Chahal)</author><guid>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/page/about/</guid><description>My name is Inderjit Singh Chahal.
I enjoy working on challenging things that are new different and rare in their implementation. I like to spend hours optimizing codes or solving complex problems through simple implementations.
I enjoy debugging complex challenges in codes, like to contribute on community platforms like StackOverflow, Reddit, etc.
In my free time I like to work with financial markets, with automated strategies augmented by artificial intelligence.</description></item><item><title>Portfolio</title><link>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/page/portfolio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>chahalinder0007.gmail.com (Inderjit Singh Chahal)</author><guid>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/page/portfolio/</guid><description>Feedback</description></item></channel></rss>
