There was a lot of backlash from people saying its wrong to use mathematics to make money and whatnot. My point simply is, if people are aware they can have a look at mathematics in a different light and can adopt it in general life to make informed decisions.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/page/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>chahalinder0007.gmail.com (Inderjit Singh Chahal)</author><guid>https://chahalinder0007.github.io/page/about/</guid><description>My name is Inderjit Singh Chahal.
I enjoy working on challenging things that are new different and rare in their implementation. I like to spend hours optimizing codes or solving complex problems through simple implementations.
I enjoy debugging complex challenges in codes, like to contribute on community platforms like StackOverflow, reddit etc.
In my free time I like to work with financial markets, with autmated stratergies augemted by artificial intelligence.</description></item></channel></rss>
