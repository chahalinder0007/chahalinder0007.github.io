            <p class='collapse' id='collapse-atm'>complete package to monitor and secure Automated teller machiens(ATMs) which was implemented using tensorflow, keras, opencv, Prometheus, grafana, web-sockets etc.The project enabled an AI (trained and tested on a custom dataset) to monitor all ATMs without any human assistance, The AI was successfully able to detect, posture number of people presence of a suspicious object aggressive expressions and was able to generate an alert when the customisable conditions were met. The rest of the information was still streamed to a central server with graphic interface for a single point human monitoring. </p>
