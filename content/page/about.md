My name is Inderjit Singh Chahal. 

I enjoy working on challenging things that are new different and rare in their implementation. I like to spend hours optimizing codes or solving complex problems through simple implementations.

I love to design architectures for cloud based applications, I am also a [`Google Certified Cloud Engineer`](https://www.credential.net/384317b7-698c-49b2-b68a-ebdab59b8f46)

I enjoy debugging complex challenges in codes, like to contribute on community platforms like StackOverflow, Reddit, etc.

In my free time I like to work with **financial markets**, with **automated strategies** augmented by **artificial intelligence**. 

### My history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://youtu.be/yhhCVGBNFMo) and it will answer **all** your questions.
