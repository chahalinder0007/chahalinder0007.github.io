Simple applied mathematics for logical decisions in-game of shells or stocks maybe
I shared this post that takes a simple example of Geometric progression and shows how you can quantize and make logical decisions in a game of shells, essentially betting on the outcome to be always profitable.

There was a lot of backlash from people saying its wrong to use mathematics to make money and whatnot. My point simply is, if people are aware they can have a look at mathematics in a different light and can adopt it in general life to make informed decisions.

The kind of decisions where we maybe do our own investments, manage and protect our financials to lead a more prosperous life.

Do read and share your thoughts around the same, is this the best optimal result possible or can we do better than.
