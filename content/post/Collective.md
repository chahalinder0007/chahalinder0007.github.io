In this blog we will try and explore the implementation of the Bayes Theorm beyond the classical cases and try to get some useful information out of one of the implementation for a real world situation.
We will be reviewing the probability of getting a positive experience from buying a product online given that there are number of sellers available and all of them have different positive reviews based on different number of total reviews for the same product.
